/**
 *  flash protection mechanism description:
 *  default Protection Size(modify flash_init_list and turn FLASH_PROTECT_MODIFY_CONFIG on if modifying the flash protection size):
 *    - protect half of the flash space size;
 *    - if there is no choice of half the flash space size, the minimum enumeration is selected;
 *  @attention:
 *     flash_init_list(block_size),the application layer is modified as required,the suggestion:
 *     Only the firmware area will be locked, the data area will not be locked.
 *       - If the frequency of data area writing is very high, it is necessary to add protection frequently,
 *         resulting in the number of times to write the flash status register quickly reached the upper limit,
 *         which may cause the read flash status register read wrong;
 *       - during the power-down process, if the flash status register is operated,
 *         there is a risk of mistakenly operating the flash status register, resulting in the failure of the qe enable,
 *         as well as causing the flash to be in a non-software protection, which cannot be unlocked,
 *         and the probability of the above risk is increased if the data area is written more frequently,
 *         and cancel protection and adding protection is done continuously.
