 *                      - The initialized interrupt threshold can only be 0, because the PLIC threshold will be set to 0 when the flash functions returns.
 *                      - During the flash functions execution, it can be interrupted by external interrupts with priority greater than given threshold
 *                      - machine timer and software interrupt will definitely interrupt the flash functions execution, they are not controlled by the plic interrupt threshold
 *                  - In other cases(preempt_en = 0 or plic_preempt_feature_en = 0), global interrupts (including machine timer and software interrupt) will be turned off during the execution of the flash functions and will be restored when the flash functions exits.
